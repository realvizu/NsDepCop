## v2.0.0

The big change in this version is that the implementation changed from MSBuild task + Visual Studio Extension to a standard Roslyn analyzer.

  - [x] NsDepCop must be added to a project as a NuGet package.
  - [x] Appears in Solution Explorer: project / Dependencies / Analyzers / NsDepCop.Analyzer

  - [x] Works both at build time and inside Visual Studio editor.
  - [x] Requires Visual Studio 2019 (16.10.0 or later).
  - [x] Supports .NET Core / .NET 5 / etc. projects too.
  - [x] Uses Roslyn 3.9.0.

Stuff that was removed:
  - [x] No need for the NsDepCop Visual Studio Extension any more.
  - [x] No need for the out-of-process service host any more.
  - [x] Dropped support for VS 2015/2017. For those, use NsDepCop v1.11.0.

## v1.7.1

- [x] Changed: MSI installer modified.
  - [x] Option (default on): config.nsdepcop XML schema support updated.
  - [x] Option (default off): Machine-wide MSBuild integration. Not recommended any more, use the NuGet (per-project) distribution instead.

- [x] Fixed: 
  - [x] Types in enum and delegate declarations were not analyzed.

### Upgrading

* To upgrade please uninstall the previous version first. 
  * Your existing config.nsdepcop files will be preserved.
* Then install the new version. 
  * Recommended: change to per-project MSBuild integration with NuGet. See [README.md](README.md) for details.
  * Please note that if you don't uninstall the previous version then its machine-wide MSBuild integration will override the per-project integration provided by the NuGet package and the old analyzer version will run at build time.
